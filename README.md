## Features üöÄ

**Project Management:** Create, list, and delete main projects.

**Sub-Project Management:** Add, list, and delete sub-projects within main projects.

**Time Tracking:** Start, stop, and view the current work session. Automatically stops the previous session when a new one begins.

**Reporting & Analysis:**

- **Daily & Date Range Reports:** Generate detailed reports for specific days or periods.
- **Inactivity Tracking:** Identify main and sub-projects that have been inactive for a configurable duration.

**Local Data Storage:** All project data and time entries are saved in a `data.json` file in the application's directory.

**Automatic Updates:** The application can check for new versions on GitHub upon exit and install them on the next start.

**Multiple Interfaces:**

- **Interactive CLI:** A user-friendly command-line interface (`TimeTrackerCLI.py`) for manual operations.
- **MCP & API Server:** An alternative server (`TimeTrackerMCP.py`) provides a machine-controllable interface via stdin/stdout and a full HTTPS REST API for programmatic control.

**Unit Testing:** Includes comprehensive unit tests in `test_TimeTracker.py` for feature reliability.

## Prerequisites üìã

- **Python 3.x:** Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

---

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/FrankFaulstich/TimeControl.git](https://github.com/FrankFaulstich/TimeControl.git)
cd TimeControl```

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The application will also attempt to self-install missing dependencies on first run.

---

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

The application can be configured via the `config.json` file.

```json
{
    "update": {
        "github_repo": "FrankFaulstich/TimeControl"
    }
}
```

- **`update.github_repo`**: The GitHub repository (username/reponame) to check for new versions.

---

## Usage ‚öôÔ∏è

### Running the Interactive CLI

To start the interactive command-line interface, run:

```bash
python TimeTrackerCLI.py
```

### Running the MCP / API Server

The server provides programmatic access via standard I/O and a REST API. To start it, run:

```bash
python TimeTrackerMCP.py
```

**Note on HTTPS:** The API server requires an SSL certificate. You can generate a local, self-signed certificate using `openssl`. The server looks for `cert.pem` and `key.pem` in the project directory.

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -out cert.pem -keyout key.pem -days 365 -subj "/CN=localhost"
```

- The **MCP interface** accepts JSON commands on `stdin` (e.g., `{"command": "list_main_projects", "params": {}}`).
- The **API interface** runs by default on `https://localhost:8443`. You can access endpoints like `GET /projects` or `GET /version`.

### CLI Menu Options

The interactive CLI provides a structured menu for all operations.

**Main Menu:**

```text
=== Time Control [version] ===
--- Main Menu ---
1. Start work on sub-project
2. Show current work
3. Stop current work
------------------------------------------------
4. Handle projects and sub-projects
5. Reporting
------------------------------------------------
0. Exit
```

**Project Management Submenu (Option 4):**

```text
--- Project Management ---
1.  Add Main Project
2.  List Main Projects
3.  Rename Main Project
4.  Delete Main Project
5.  List Inactive Main Projects
--------------------------------
6.  Add Sub-Project
7.  List Sub-Projects
8.  Rename Sub-Project
9.  Delete Sub-Project
10. Move Sub-Project
11. List Inactive Sub-Projects
--------------------------------
0.  Back to Main Menu
```

## Building the Documentation üìö

This project uses Sphinx to generate documentation from the docstrings in the source code.

1. **Install dependencies:**
    Make sure you have installed the required packages for building the docs:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Build the HTML documentation:**
    Navigate to the `docs` directory and use the `make` command:

    ```bash
    cd docs
    make html
    ```

    The generated documentation can be found in `docs/_build/html/index.html`.

## Data Storage üóÑÔ∏è

All your project data, including main projects, sub-projects, and time entries, is automatically saved in a local file named **`data.json`** in the same directory as the script. This file is created upon the first run if it doesn't exist.

The `data.json` file has the following structure:

```json
{
  "projects": [
    {
      "main_project_name": "Example Main Project",
      "sub_projects": [
        {
          "sub_project_name": "Example Sub-Project 1",
          "time_entries": [
            {
              "start_time": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.ffffff",
              "end_time": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.ffffff"
            },
            {
              "start_time": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.ffffff"
              // "end_time" is missing if the entry is still active
            }
          ]
        },
        // ... other sub-projects
      ]
    },
    // ... other main projects
  ]
}
```

Time entries are stored in **ISO 8601 format** (e.g., `"2025-09-12T09:30:00.123456"`). If an `end_time` is missing for a `time_entry`, it means that time tracking is currently active for that sub-project.
